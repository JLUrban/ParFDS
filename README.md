The code is a number of files plus an example FDS input file. 

 - parFDS.py - the code which orchestrates the calls to FDS and wrapping
 - example_input_file.fds - an example modified FDS input template

Most of the important stuff takes place after the if `__name__ == '__main__'` in ParFDS.py 

Here's a walkthrough: 

The first line which defines 'input_file' tells the code where to look for the template input file.

Parameters are defined via an augmented FDS/GPyro syntax which is parsed in the code base. Variables in this syntax for these parametric studies are `{Variable_Name SWEEP First_Value, Second_Value, Number_Steps}`, where `SWEEP` is a protected word which lets ParFDS know that we will be attempting a linear parametric study in that variable.

Parameters can be constrained by using the __optional__ keyword `axis` followed by the `axis_index`, an integer number denoting what group of swept parameters it belongs to. This is implemented with the following syntax: `{Variable_Name SWEEP First_Value, Second_Value, Number_Steps, axis, axis_index}`

The 'kwargs', dictionary sets things like: 
  - 'test_name' - which is the prefix appended to all the generated FDS input files and folder names
  - 'base_path' - the name of the base folder which will contain the folders and input files generated by the code (assumed to be under the folder containing pafFDS.py)
 - 'funct' : the actual subprocess call for fds_mpi (please see this function if you want to turn mpi on or off or set the -np flag for mpirun) if you are not using mpi it is a trivial change on the `subprocess.call` line.
 - 'multiproc' is currently set to True, creating the multiprocessing pool used throughout. 
 - 'pool_size' the number of workers in the pool

Note, that if you use `mpirun -np X` and set `pool_size` to `Y`, the number of processes you will have running is `X*Y` at any one time as the code will spin up `Y` workers, which will each make an mpirun call, spinning up `X` processes. 

The code is then run using the main function, with the syntax:

main(input_file, parameters, **kwargs)

One more thing: in the example_input_file.fds example file, certain of the variables are in curley braces eg. {COLD_TEMP SWEEP 20, 20, 1}. That is actually used for the variable replacement in Python, which occurs in build_input_files() in helper_functions.py. The point here is that if the key 'STEP_WMAX' exists in the parameters dictionary, and also exists in the FDS input file in the form `{COLD_TEMP SWEEP 20, 20, 1}`, the code will know to replace that string with the appropriate numerical value when it generates the input files. 

Functional Note: the current fork fo this code has only been run under Ubuntu, and it is not known if it will work on Windows. **Work In Progress: Unit testing - guidance on testing will be updated soon.** ~~If you are going to use this on Windows, please ensure (at a minimum) that the command 'nosetests ./tests/*.py' run at the command prompt passes first. ~~
